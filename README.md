# Newsfeed Application
BCIT Digital Design and Development - Term 3 Individual Project

### Purpose:
- Use React to create real-time newsfeed pages like facebook newsfeed.
- Use Facebook API to allow people to leave messages with their facebook account.
- Store the messages in the database for other users to see.

### Outcome:
- Use React js to make the content update automatically without having to refresh the page.
- Implement Google API for the user to pick their location rather than typing out the location manually in the input.
- Use Facebook API to grab user's information which auto-fills the inputs with the facebook information.
- Using AJAX to store content in the database within the React JS.
